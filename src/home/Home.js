            I've always been deeply obsessed with technology, from playing and
            ‘designing’ video games as a child, to producing music
            electronically, to photography & video editing, projection mapping,
            electric vehicles, and more...

            My obsession with tech and my college experience in Marketing and
            Tourism & Hospitality Management eventually pushed me toward a
            career in software sales, where I worked for 6 years and learned
            invaluable lessons, mostly around communication, problem solving,
            and effort & time management.
          </h3>

          <h4>
            My eagerness and passion to continue learning, and my desire to be
            more creative and utilize my knowledge and experience gained through
            utilizing literally hundreds of softwares both at work and at home,
            had me itching for something new. I decided to take some online
            software engineering classes, and ultimately to go to Flatiron
            School for Software Engineering, where I learned a ton about the
            fundamentals, and deep dove into js, react, node, ruby, and rails -
            as well as a bunch of 3rd party api’s and node packages that allowed
            me to get extra creative.

          <h4>
            I now absolutely love both sides of the equation; being able to
            speak the language and contribute to code bases, imagine and create
            beautiful and powerful user interfaces, build and analyze databases,
            and problem solve quickly and efficiently while communicating in a
            more clear and concise way.
